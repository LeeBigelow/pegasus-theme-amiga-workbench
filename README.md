# Amiga Workbench theme for Pegasus

Based on the [Amiga Workbench](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-theme-workbench) for EmulationStation

The mixed image game screenshots are generated by [Skyscraper](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/tree/master)

The underlying art and mechanics are from the [Slatest](https://github.com/LeeBigelow/pegasus-theme-slatest/archive/master.zip) theme and all it's sources and contributors.
