# Notes:

- Based on the [Amiga Workbench EmulationStation Theme](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-theme-workbench) as discussed on the [retropie forum](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/5552/release-amiga-workbench-emulationstation-theme) back in 2016.
- The underlying art and mechanics are from the [Slatest](https://github.com/LeeBigelow/pegasus-theme-slatest) theme and all it's sources and contributors.
- Game mixed image screenshots generated by [Skyscraper](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/tree/master)
- Theme testing "dummy roms" and all-in-one `metadata.pegasus.txt`: [Pegasus Dummy Roms](https://github.com/LeeBigelow/pegasus-frontend-dummy-roms)
